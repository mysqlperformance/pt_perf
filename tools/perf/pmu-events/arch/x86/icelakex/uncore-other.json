Generally, when data is transmitted across UPI, it will bypass the TxQ and pass directly to the link.  However, the TxQ will be used with L0p and when LLR occurs, increasing latency to transfer out to the link. This can be used with the cycles not empty event to track average occupancy, or the allocations event to track average lifetime in the TxQ.",
